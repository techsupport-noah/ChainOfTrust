## Overview

Chain of Trust is a webapp designed to let you interact with our contract. We aim to bring a little more trust into the crypto game by providing a trust score/reputation based system. As we write each contribution to project onto the chain, everything is transparent and permanent. There is no chance for scammers to just delete their negative review. Once on the chain, always on the chain.

Our Webapp gives you access to:
- contribution features
